# TicketBot
Commission ticket bot for Ink Overflow community discord. This project manages commission requests from Rec Room users by creating a 'ticket' for each request in the Ink Overflow discord server where clients and merchants can coordinate. 

# How to use
Download the source code and provide the config.json file with six elements:
> An API key for your bot 

> The ID of your discord server 

> The public category ID for tickets 

> The private category ID for pre-approved tickets
